        new image with a different fingerprint to the one sent with the request

    Re-purpose the cluster page, access it by clicking a cluster on the dashboard

    Bulk action to stop containers (#184)
    Bulk action to start containers (#185)
    Add (optional) select GPU when deploying a cloud config (#199)

Changed
    Renamespaced & updated class names for lots of "Containers" to "Instances"
    to be consistent with the way we use LXD API, this will break any scripts

    When creating a usedBy link fetch image details and show user freindly name
    instead of fingerprint (#186)

    Use apiToken to authenticate user on API requests as part of the journey
    to a "statless api" (so client apps can exist) the current caveat is that
    the project will default to "default" for every request, until we move the
    data into the database (#180)

    are initialized to fix modals not hiding (#177)

    Typos (#190)
    Ensure that an instance is created where the user asked it to be (#196)

0.7.0 - 12/04/2020

Added
    Access control - This will break any existing scripts that you may have,
        it uses sessions for everything which isn't good API design (stateful)
        so ill have to switch to using the tokens to authenticate the API

        This includes the basic functionality to login, add users & reset passwords
        it doesn't add any kind of per user restrictions!

        Thanks to Shem Pasamba (@shemgp) for implementing the user token
        functionality for the node server and that will be used for api requests
        in the future.
